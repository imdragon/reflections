What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	You create a hidden file that will track commits for that repository.  You need to do this in order to start tracking changes to your files.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is where things area held before they are committed to the repository.  It allows you to build up a group of changes before you commit them to the repository log.
