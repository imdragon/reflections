What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	You create a hidden file that will track commits for that repository.  You need to do this in order to start tracking changes to your files.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is where things area held before they are committed to the repository.  It allows you to build up a group of changes before you commit them to the repository log.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	The staging area allows you to double check what you are going to commit to the repository before it is actually added.  This will allow you to add and remove the files you want to commit with a specific message.
